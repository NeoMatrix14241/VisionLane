## Features

- 🚀 GPU-accelerated OCR processing using CUDA
- 📁 Batch processing support for multiple files
- 📄 Support for multiple input formats (TIFF, JPEG, PNG, PDF)
- 🔄 Concurrent processing with multi-threading
- 💾 Output in PDF and HOCR formats
- 🖥️ PyQt6-based GUI interface
- 📊 Real-time processing status and GPU metrics
- 🔍 High-accuracy text recognition using DocTR
- 🌙 Dark mode, light mode, and night mode themes with system default support
- 🧩 User-selectable DocTR detection and recognition models with auto-download if missing
- ⚙️ Configurable DPI, output format, and compression options (JPEG, JPEG2000, LZW, PNG)
- 🗜️ PDF compression with Ghostscript auto-detection (PATH or Program Files, highest version auto-selected)
- 🛠️ Performance tuning: adjustable thread count and timeouts
- 🧹 Safe resource cleanup and robust error handling
- 📂 Remembers last used input/output directories and settings
- 🖼️ Real-time progress display with current file and processed count
- 🔒 Settings saved to config.ini for persistent preferences
- 🧭 Guided dialogs for missing dependencies (e.g., Ghostscript "Learn More" button)
- 📝 Logging to file for troubleshooting
- 📦 **Archiving Option:** After processing, optionally move input files/folders to a specified archive directory, preserving the original folder structure. Archiving is configurable per input mode and settings are saved in config.ini.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (Tested from 3.10 to 3.12.6)
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ RAM and CUDA/recently supported drivers (optional, else will fallback to CPU)
- Windows/Linux OS
- [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) (required **only** for PDF compression features; optional otherwise)

## Roadmap

The following features and improvements are planned for future releases:

### 🔧 Functional Improvements
- [x] Fix initialization of models if not found after build  
  _→ Automatically download or notify if models are missing in cache directory (`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.doctr\cache\*.pt`)_
- [x] Add custom selection for DocTR text detection and recognition models  
  _→ User-selectable models for more flexibility and accuracy tuning_
- [x] Implement a config file to persist user settings  
  _→ Save UI preferences, text detection and text recognition model selections, input/output/archive options, select processor if CPU or GPU etc._
- [x] **Archiving option for processed files**  
  _→ Optionally move processed input files/folders to a specified archive directory, preserving folder structure. Archive settings are saved and restored from config.ini._

### 📁 File Handling Enhancements
- [x] Add option to archive processed files  
  _→ Automatically move completed input files to a separate folder preserving structure_
- [x] Add compression function for output PDFs  
  _→ Preserve searchable text while applying JPEG-based compression_
- [x] Fix where it suddenly creates output folder in the repository when running  
  _→ It remains there ever since I started making it as CLI based OCR processor_

### 🎨 UI/UX Features
- [x] Add dark mode toggle and various bug fixes  
  _→ Supports system default, with manual switch option_  
  _→ Includes various bug fixes to the GUI also_
- [x] Add night mode and improved theme switching
- [x] Show real-time progress and current file being processed
- [x] Add "Unavailable: Learn More?" button for missing Ghostscript with helpful dialog
- [x] Improved error dialogs and resource cleanup
- [x] Save and restore all user settings (including last-used paths, models, compression, and archiving options)
- [x] Auto-detect Ghostscript in PATH and Program Files (uses highest version found)
- [x] Robust logging to file for all sessions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeoMatrix14241/VisionLane.git
cd VisionLane
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Test CUDA availability (optional):
```bash
python test_cuda.py
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Using the GUI:
   - Select input mode (Single File/Folder/PDF)
   - Choose input file(s) and output directory
   - (Optional) Enable "Archiving?" and specify an archive directory to move processed input files/folders after OCR. The original folder structure will be preserved in the archive.
   - Configure processing options (DPI, output format, compression)
   - Click "Start Processing" to begin OCR

### Input Formats Supported:
- Images: TIFF, JPEG, PNG
- Documents: PDF

### Output Formats:
- Searchable PDFs
- HOCR (HTML-based OCR) files

### Archiving Option

- If "Archiving?" is enabled, after successful processing, input files/folders are moved to the specified archive directory, preserving their folder structure.
- Archive settings are saved in `config.ini` and restored on next launch.
- If archiving is not enabled or the archive path is not specified, input files are not moved.
- Proper error handling is provided if the archive directory is missing or invalid.
