## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (Tested from 3.10 to 3.12.6)
- [REQUIRED / CRITICAL] NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ RAM (Important or it will crash then you have to restart the App) and CUDA/recently supported drivers (optional, else will fallback to CPU)
- Windows 10 or Higher
- [GhostScript](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) (required **only** for PDF compression features; optional otherwise)

## Roadmap

The following features and improvements are planned for future releases:

### üîß Functional Improvements
- [x] Fix initialization of models if not found after build  
  _‚Üí Automatically download or notify if models are missing in cache directory (`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.doctr\cache\*.pt`)_
- [x] Add custom selection for DocTR text detection and recognition models  
  _‚Üí User-selectable models for more flexibility and accuracy tuning_
- [x] Implement a config file to persist user settings  
  _‚Üí Save UI preferences, text detection and text recognition model selections, input/output/archive options, select processor if CPU or GPU etc._
- [x] **Archiving option for processed files**  
  _‚Üí Optionally move processed input files/folders to a specified archive directory, preserving folder structure. Archive settings are saved and restored from config.ini._
- [x] **Hotfix:** App builder now includes all modules needed for PyPDFCompressor  
  _‚Üí The module: fitz (PyMuPDF) are not included in build.spec file which is required for PyPDFCompressor_
- [x] **Hotfix:** Removed PyMuPDF/fitz import/module  
  _‚Üí PDF compression now relies solely on Ghostscript; all fitz/PyMuPDF code and dependencies have been removed for better compatibility for Nuitka._
- [ ] Add an option to switch GPU and CPU  
  _‚Üí GPU acceleration can be disabled and use CPU instead_
- [ ] Add a function to check if the recommended 8GB VRAM is met, else suggest to switch to CPU  
  _‚Üí Below 6GB are crashing often based on my tests_
- [ ] Add super-image enhancement to standardize image sizes  
  _‚Üí Use super-image and a formula (see paper_sizes_formula.xlsl) to automatically resize/enhance images so all output PDFs have consistent paper sizes (e.g., A4), ensuring uniform appearance in any PDF viewer._

### üìÅ File Handling Enhancements
- [x] Add option to archive processed files  
  _‚Üí Automatically move completed input files to a separate folder preserving structure_
- [x] Add compression function for output PDFs  
  _‚Üí Preserve searchable text while applying JPEG-based compression_
- [x] Fix where it suddenly creates output folder in the repository when running  
  _‚Üí It remains there ever since I started making it as CLI based OCR processor_

### üé® UI/UX Features
- [x] Add dark mode toggle and various bug fixes  
  _‚Üí Supports system default, with manual switch option_  
  _‚Üí Includes various bug fixes to the GUI also_
- [x] Add night mode and improved theme switching
- [x] Change GUI style/theme
- [x] Show real-time progress and current file being processed
- [x] Add "Unavailable: Learn More?" button for missing GhostScript with helpful dialog
- [x] Improved error dialogs and resource cleanup
- [x] Save and restore all user settings (including last-used paths, models, compression, and archiving options)
- [x] Auto-detect GhostScript in PATH and Program Files (uses highest version found)
- [x] Robust logging to file for all sessions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeoMatrix14241/VisionLane.git
cd VisionLane
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Test CUDA availability (optional):
```bash
python test_cuda.py
```

## Build

You can build VisionLane OCR as a standalone executable using either Nuitka (recommended for fast startup) or PyInstaller.

### Build with Nuitka (Recommended)

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the build script:
    ```bat
    build_nuitka.bat
    ```

   - The output will be in the `dist` directory.
   - By default, this uses "onedir" mode (a folder with all dependencies).

### Build with PyInstaller (Alternative)

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the PyInstaller build script:
    ```bat
    build_pyinstaller.bat
    ```

   - The output will be in the `dist` directory.
   - This uses the `build.spec` file for configuration.

**Note:**  
- Ensure you have the correct Python version (3.10‚Äì3.12) and a compatible NVIDIA GPU for best performance.
- The build scripts will automatically verify and download required DocTR models before building.

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Using the GUI:
   - Select input mode (Single File/Folder/PDF)
   - Choose input file(s) and output directory
   - (Optional) Enable "Archiving?" and specify an archive directory to move processed input files/folders after OCR. The original folder structure will be preserved in the archive.
   - Configure processing options (DPI, output format, compression)
   - Click "Start Processing" to begin OCR

### Input Formats Supported:
- Images: TIFF, JPEG, PNG
- Documents: PDF

### Output Formats:
- Searchable PDFs
- HOCR (HTML-based OCR) files

### Archiving Option

- If "Archiving?" is enabled, after successful processing, input files/folders are moved to the specified archive directory, preserving their folder structure.
- Archive settings are saved in `config.ini` and restored on next launch.
- If archiving is not enabled or the archive path is not specified, input files are not moved.
- Proper error handling is provided if the archive directory is missing or invalid.
